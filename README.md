# RPM-meter-with-STM32-and-Hall-sensor
This repo contains all documents for RPM meter. This project is released under CERN Open Hardware license

## What are the folders here and how to use them?

1. Firmware:
You can access the firmware of the mircrocontroller (written for STM32f103) in the "firmware" folder.
You will need ARM MDK V5 to open the project. note that all of the required document to build a new project (in any env that you want) is in the firmware folder. You only need to define the paths of .h files and also you will need to add all of .c files into your project (to be compiled)

2. Schematics:
 This folder contains the schematics of the controller. you can easily make the PCB based on the files in this folder.


3. media:
Any other content (video, image, etc) are included in this folder)
